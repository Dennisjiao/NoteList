CSC8021 Coursework 1 simulators
===============================

Use Version 1 for the first section, Version 2 for the second section.

NModel can be used for both sections and is (occasionally) more accurate, though it does not have the nice animations of the other two simulators.

I have provided a .cmd batch file for launching them from Windows, make sure you have a JRE/JDK (Java Runtime Environment or Java Development Kit) installed first - this will already be installed if you have installed a Java IDE for your programming modules.

If you have a Mac or Linux system, you can run the programs from the terminal program with the following command:

java -jar <program name goes here>.jar

Any questions, please email me (daniel.nesbitt@newcastle.ac.uk).

Cheers,

Dan
